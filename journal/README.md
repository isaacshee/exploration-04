# Link and Journal

You may insert your link and journal into this directory

Please include the screenshots in your journal for easy access.

How did it go? Write about the topic you explored and what you experienced. This is your documentation.

The documentation is a journal-style document that details the stuff you have explored.

Your journal that reflects

- overview of task (title)
- what you learned (explanation)
- problems you faced (what did you learn or what problems occurred)
- and how you solved them (explain what you did or how you solved the problem)
- references (make sure you reference your work!!!)

The journal will be named “\<Pawpring\>Journal” with the corresponding file extension .md

For example: “Abc123Journal.md”

Your journal should be

- clear
- easy to read
- and be of some help

If the TAs are reading it, the journal should guide them through your findings and it should show off how much you explored.

Do not submit a word document or a text file, make sure it is a nicely formatted MarkDown file otherwise you will get points taken off

Make sure your document is easy to read and using correct markdown

**Note:** You can implement an ordered or unordered list similar to challenge 1 and 2 or you can make your own style. The main thing is that the journal is clear, easy to read, and when the TA follows it, your "tutorial" actually works.

Use this for a reference: [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

If you go back and run through the material again or think about the TA reading this journal, it should help to guide them through your findings. Almost like your own personal tutorial with explanations.

If you are unclear what you need to do for this, then please let me or TAs know.
